<p>The <b>{{ period.name }}</b> decision period is in progress as part of the <b>{{ dialog.name }}</b> discussion.  You may post {{ period.max_messages }} candidate message(s) by clicking the “Start new thread” button.  You must post your candidate message(s) by {{ period.endposting }}.  Voting continues until {{ period.endrating }} at which time final results of the decision period will be available.  Click the “Results” button to see the winners.</p>

<p><b>More help:</b> Post your candidate by clicking “Start New Thread”.  If the button is greyed out, that means you have already posted your maximum number of candidates.  The “Decision Special” sort shows only candidate messages, with your message at the top followed by candidates you have not yet rated.  Change the “Thread” parameter to “Roots+Replies” to see replies.  Change the “Decision period” parameter to “All messages” to see messages posted before the current decision period.

<p><b>The big picture:</b> groups come together in discussions.  Discussions have decision periods where participants from all groups together decide a particular question by posting and rating “candidate” messages.  For each decision period, there is one overall winning message billed as the “Voice of Humanity as One”, one winning message for each group, and a winning message for each of the other Voices of Humanity: the Voice of Women, of Men, of Youth, of Experience (middle-age) and of Wisdom (seniors).</p>
